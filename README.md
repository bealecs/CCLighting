# Cross & Carlile Lighting ðŸ’¡ðŸŒ™

#### My older brother (Tyler) and good friend (Noah) run an exterior lighting business located in south-eastern Virginia. As business has started picking up for them, I thought that I would make them a landing page to showcase some of their work in a professional "light".

#### This page includes a navbar with links to a gallery of their showcased work, a product page to be transparent with customers about products and warranties that they utilize, an about page to learn more about the company, reviews on the customer testimonials page, and of course a hero section featuring some cool drone footage. Finally, you can even send their business email a personalized message to get in contact with the company. 

#### This project was created using NPM Create React App. This project is a fairly simple one, with no user authentication or API calls. With this project, I more so wanted to focus on my UI/UX design and making the website look nice.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
