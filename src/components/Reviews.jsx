                    <p>From design to installation, Cross and Carlisle created our backyard lighting project that exceeds our expectations for an aesthetically pleasing landscape retreat. The owners are knowledgeable, professional, creative, and careful with existing plants and turf. 
                        We are thrilled about choosing their services for our project, and we give them our highest recommendation. N. Baker

                    <p>The team of Cross & Carlile listened to what I wanted, met my budget, and developed a wonderful landscaping plan for my back and side yard. The end result was better than I would have ever expected and the guys were as excited as I was at the final result.
                         Although I don't anticipate any problems with the lighting project in the future, I'm confident they will take care of any snags. 
                         I wish all my house projects could go as smoothly as my experience with Noah and Tyler. Great job, guys!</p>
